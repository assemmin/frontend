This project is created using **React + Vite** and demonstrates basic rendering with JSX, fragments, reusable components, and list rendering.


Implemented the following components:

- **FragmentLayout** — uses React Fragments only  
- **ItemList** — renders a list using `map` and `key`  
- **CombinedFragment** — combines fragments, list rendering, and total calculation  


Implemented reusable and structured components:

- **Card** — reusable card component  
- **ProductList** — renders products using mapping  
- **Section** — fragment-based wrapper component
